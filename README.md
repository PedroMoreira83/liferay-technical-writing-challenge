# Technical Writing Challenge - Liferay, Inc.

This repository contains my submissions for the Technical Writing interview exercises.

## Repository Structure
* **Exercise1.md**: A user-focused manual for DVR operations, featuring structured sections and visual aids.
* **Exercise2.md**: A wordsmithed version of Enterprise Edition documentation, optimized for clarity and brevity.
* **Exercise3.md**: Javadoc documentation for the `StringUtil.insert` method, following standard Javadoc conventions.

## Technical Notes
* **Format**: All files are provided in Markdown (`.md`) to ensure compatibility with version control systems and technical documentation workflows.
* **Encoding**: Files are saved in **UTF-8** format to preserve the integrity of technical symbols (?, ?, ?).
* **Edge Case Handling**: In Exercise 3, the Javadoc explicitly documents the method's behavior when a `null` string is provided, ensuring developer clarity.
